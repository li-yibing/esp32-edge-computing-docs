# Parameter `Intervall`
Default Value: `5`

Interval in minutes in which the Flow (Digitization Round) is run.
If a rund takes longer than this interval, the next round gets postponed until the current round completes.

!!! Note
    Due to a typo, it is called `Intervall` instead of `Interval`.
    For backwards compatibility, this did not get changed.
