# Living on the edge
The branch [rolling](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/tree/rolling) contains the latest version of the Firmware and the Web Interface. It might already contain a fix for your issue. But it is work in progress, don't expect it to work stable or be an improvement for your AI-on-the-edge-device! Also it might break the [OTA Update](../ota) and thus require manual flashing over USB!

## You still want to try it?

Grab the latest `rolling` build from [Github Actions](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/actions/workflows/build.yaml?query=branch%3Arolling) Page and proceed as following:

1. Pick the most top successful (green) build.
2. Download the `AI-on-the-edge-device__update__rolling_*.zip`
5. Flash the zip file using the [OTA Update](../ota) page of your device.
